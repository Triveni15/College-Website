This is my first attempt at making a web page 
Arena 2.0
Arena 2.0 is the second version of SIESGSTarena. In this version, we are completely redesigning the UI. We are also moving to the MERN stack to deliver a good user experience.

About The Project
You can have a look at our Arena 2.0 The project is focused on providing a good UI and performance to our end users in order to provide them a good coding experience. We are making use of material UI components (provided by Google) and material design guidelines to redesign our website.

Project Structure
The project structure is based on the idea of keeping all the components and assets required by a route in its own separate folder. The entire project is divided into 5 modules:

common: This module contains the components which are common across all the routes. e.g. The AppBar, Footer, SearchBar.
footerPages: This module contains the routes which are present in the footer. e.g about, competitions, contact, our-team, feedback, faq and privacy.
drawer: This module contains the routes which are present in the (side) drawer. e.g contests, ratings, blog, problemSet, playlists, goodies and turingCup.
user: This module contains all the user specific routes. e.g newPost, myPosts, profile and settings.
auth: This module contains all the authentication related routes. e.g signin, signup, forgotPassword and resetPassword.
search: This module contains all the search related components.
admin: This module contains all the routes and components related to the admin.
superuser: This module contains all the routes and components related to the superuser.
